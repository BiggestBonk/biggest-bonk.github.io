    Learning Pathway What is your long term goal or career pathway?<br />
    My current long term goal is to gain as many relevant skills as possible in
    my time at dev academy, so I have the confidence and competence to choose a
    specialized development pathway when the time comes.L<br />
    A description of your strengths andlimitations when it comes to learning<br />
    One of my strengths when it comes to learning is my drive to understand a
    variety of concepts. I pride myself on being a fairly adaptable person, so I
    try to approach anything new with an open mind and willingness to learn. On
    the other hand, one of my limitations when it comes to learning is my
    approach to failure when it comes up. For a lot of my education I saw
    success and failure as very concrete metrics. So when an issue arises that
    seems impassable at the time, I do tend to catastrophize and spiral until I
    (or someone else) pulls me back out to reality.<br />
    What skills(non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in
    yourself while at Dev Academy?<br />
    One skill I would like to develop over my time at Dev Academy is increasing
    my frustration threshold (as mentioned above). I hope that over this period
    I’ll learn to be a little bit kinder to myself in that regard, and learn how
    to keep a cool head whilst tackling a problem, even if it seems
    insurmountable at the time.<br />
    A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
    should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
    productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
    industry/community representatives What you will do when things are building
    up and starting to get to you<br />
    Over the past few months in preparation for this course I started doing the
    Odin project on weekdays so that getting into the rhythm for foundations and
    bootcamp wouldn't be as daunting, as well as exercising on a regular weekly
    schedule. I believe forming these routines will be (and already has been)
    beneficial for helping me stay on task and getting the job done
    consistently. If things are building up and starting to worry me, I’ll make
    a concerted effort not to panic, continue making my way through the
    workload, and ask a facilitator or other cohort member for advice/help if
    things get to be a bit too much to handle myself.<br />
    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<br />
    If the need arises for me to seek help, the first place I’d be likely to go
    to is the discord. I’d generally try to structure my question in the most
    understandable way possible, as most of the time I find specific problems
    need equally specific questions in order to formulate a solution.<br />
    A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team<br />
    I expect a constructive environment for learning, with the facilitators
    acting as guides for formulating my own solutions, rather than just
    providing the answer outright. I also hope that the facilitators offer
    alternative perspectives if I find myself stuck and frustrated with a
    certain aspect of the curriculum, maybe even imparting some wisdom from
    experiencing similar feelings at some point. Any scheduling information such
    as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you
    might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan
    these in.<br />
    In terms of scheduling, I thankfully don’t have too many commitments to keep
    up with. I’ll be exercising on mondays (times are flexible), but otherwise
    don’t have other weekly commitments that fall on weekdays. I have a
    dentist’s appointment on the 23rd of September to get all four of my wisdom
    teeth removed (oh joy) so I’ll likely be somewhat out of commision for the
    days following that. The only other commitment I have is going up for a trip
    to Auckland on November 13th in the afternoon, returning on the 16th. I have
    planned to study online during the day on the 14th and 15th, so there
    shouldn’t be any noticeable gaps in my learning.
