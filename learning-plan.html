      <div class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        current long term goal is to gain as many relevant skills as possible in
        my time at dev academy, so I have the confidence and competence to
        choose a specialized development pathway when the time comes.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        of my strengths when it comes to learning is my drive to understand a
        variety of concepts. I pride myself on being a fairly adaptable person,
        so I try to approach anything new with an open mind and willingness to
        learn. On the other hand, one of my limitations when it comes to
        learning is my approach to failure when it comes up. For a lot of my
        education I saw success and failure as very concrete metrics. So when an
        issue arises that seems impassable at the time, I do tend to
        catastrophize and spiral until I (or someone else) pulls me back out to
        reality.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        What skills(non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        skill I would like to develop over my time at Dev Academy is increasing
        my frustration threshold (as mentioned above). I hope that over this
        period I’ll learn to be a little bit kinder to myself in that regard,
        and learn how to keep a cool head whilst tackling a problem, even if it
        seems insurmountable at the time.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        the past few months in preparation for this course I started doing the
        Odin project on weekdays so that getting into the rhythm for foundations
        and bootcamp wouldn't be as daunting, as well as exercising on a regular
        weekly schedule. I believe forming these routines will be (and already
        has been) beneficial for helping me stay on task and getting the job
        done consistently. If things are building up and starting to worry me,
        I’ll make a concerted effort not to panic, continue making my way
        through the workload, and ask a facilitator or other cohort member for
        advice/help if things get to be a bit too much to handle myself.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely manner
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        the need arises for me to seek help, the first place I’d be likely to go
        to is the discord. I’d generally try to structure my question in the
        most understandable way possible, as most of the time I find specific
        problems need equally specific questions in order to formulate a
        solution.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        expect a constructive environment for learning, with the facilitators
        acting as guides for formulating my own solutions, rather than just
        providing the answer outright. I also hope that the facilitators offer
        alternative perspectives if I find myself stuck and frustrated with a
        certain aspect of the curriculum, maybe even imparting some wisdom from
        experiencing similar feelings at some point.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        terms of scheduling, I thankfully don’t have too many commitments to
        keep up with. I’ll be exercising on mondays (times are flexible), but
        otherwise don’t have other weekly commitments that fall on weekdays. I
        have a dentist’s appointment on the 23rd of September to get all four of
        my wisdom teeth removed (oh joy) so I’ll likely be somewhat out of
        commision for the days following that. The only other commitment I have
        is going up for a trip to Auckland on November 13th in the afternoon,
        returning on the 16th. I have planned to study online during the day on
        the 14th and 15th, so there shouldn’t be any noticeable gaps in my
        learning.
