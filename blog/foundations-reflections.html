    <div class="question">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills
      learning?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">One new thing that I’ve learnt about myself is that I tend to be very self-critical in most
      contexts, even when I’m coming up against challenges that I realistically should recognize I won’t ace on my first
      try. The feeling that you’ve run into an issue and need to refactor isn’t something I’m particularly used to, at
      least in such an immediate way. With most of my prior skills surrounding writing, I’m more familiar with finishing
      something regardless of the state it's in and then going back through to find mistakes on a full reread.
      <br>
      <br>
      Another thing I’ve learnt about myself during foundations is that I frankly <em>suck</em> at taking breaks. “Wow,
      is
      that
      really the best you could come up with? What an absolutely weak softball answer.” is what I’d imagine most people
      would think reading that answer (including my bastard self) but what I mean by that, is that I don’t recognise
      when
      it’s actually a fitting time to stop bashing my head against a problem and just cool down before trying to tackle
      it. Especially in some of the earlier sprints I’d find myself not even really trying to solve the problem in any
      meaningful way, instead doing my best impression of The Thinking Man until the answer just magically reveals
      itself,
      and then losing it when it inevitably doesn’t.
      <br>
      <br>
      The last thing I’ve noticed about my ego specifically throughout this is that I’m occasionally (the occasions are
      worryingly frequent, but that’s beside the point) a teeny bit over-competitive. Not in the sense that I turn
      everything into some kind of race that I absolutely have to win, but more so in the sense that I compare myself to
      others incessantly and then hit myself with the old “Why are you so slow? Want to take any more time getting to
      your
      solution Mr Snail? Kodi’s already onto the next task, pick up the pace you geriatric turtle” But the further I’ve
      gotten into this the more I’ve realized I don’t need to precisely match the pace of anyone else provided I’m
      getting
      the work done in a relatively timely manner, I do have my own brain after all.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Values play an important role in learning and programming (along with a boatload of other
      contexts) because they’re a key part in what shapes an individual's perspective. When programming in a group, ie.
      most of the time; it’s important to recognize what different aspects of the process of creation and communication
      you hold dear. Using myself as an example in the most ironically unself-aware way possible, I find injecting a bit
      of humour in most things (unless it <em>really</em> isn’t appropriate) a key part in making things like
      long-winded
      blog
      posts a bit more digestible. Humor is far from the only value worth its salt though, especially if you find
      exceedingly dry jokes exhausting, with things like honour and ethics generally being a bit more of a great-to-have
      than an occasionally funny-to-have.
      <br>
      <br>
      Empathy also plays an important role in any communication, business or otherwise. Empathy is a keystone in
      understanding where someone else is at and how they operate and respecting those parameters (which upon writing,
      sounds like a pretty cold way to put it). Without empathy, even the best employee/programmer or what have you may
      as
      well just go home and create whatever magnificent concepts they have by themselves, because lord knows no one
      would
      want to be around, let alone actually talk to the most unflinching rude robot of a person. Imagine working
      alongside
      someone who constantly undermined every single thing you did because they did it faster and prettier than you
      could,
      it doesn’t exactly sound like a hoot to me.
      <br>
      <br>
      Self-awareness is another necessary skill to have when programming and learning, as it allows for you to recognise
      your shortcomings and strengths and when it could be best to utilise them or step back and alter your approach. It
      also quite closely correlates with empathy, as recognising that you’re flawed can make it easier to realise that
      literally everyone is. Without self-awareness you’re on the express train to hypocrite-ville, and people aren’t
      generally keen to work or communicate with self-righteous hypocrite-villians.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What has surprised you the most about Human Skills learning?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Honestly, one of the things that surprised me the most about this portion of the course, is
      that it’s given me enough to think and write about to take over 700 words to answer the previous questions. On a
      more serious note, I was actually very surprised by how helpful reflecting on the things that I’ve done so far has
      been. Before this course I’d generally pick up a task/activity and either finish or have my fill of it and then
      just
      immediately toss it aside for the next thing. Throughout these past weeks though its given me some perspective as
      to
      why reflecting isn’t just some superfluous waste of time, and why actually taking time to ruminate allows things
      to
      nestle their way into your brain more effectively (even if that sounds horrific)
    </div>
    <div class="question">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills
      learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">I think it makes a lot of sense for a course that focuses on trying to get people relatively
      work-ready to focus on things other than the pure meat and potatoes of programming. Working in an environment as
      collaborative as most programming jobs takes more than just knowing how to write a concise script, it is honestly
      almost as (if not more) important to be able to communicate and effectively synergise with the people around you.
      Even on a personal level, parts of the Human Skills exercises are great for recognizing your own communication
      style and how it can jive or possibly cause friction with others.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should
      you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">In the beginning, there was nothing but immense darkness until…No. In the actual beginning of
      the course I was pretty down on the whole idea of writing a bunch of abstract mini-essays about <em>feelings</em>
      of all
      things, but the more the course went on, the more I realised why it was there. At first I’d just hammer out what
      felt like acceptable enough fluff-filled answers that were more packing-peanuts than product. The further I got in
      the more I let down those frankly goofy stoic walls so that I could actually process what I was feeling rather
      than just trying to go all cool and mysterious with it.
