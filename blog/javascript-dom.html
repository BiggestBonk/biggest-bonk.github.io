    <div class="question">Who or what is this “DOM”, and what does he or it do exactly?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">The DOM (document object model) serves as a connecting tree for all of the elements within
      your document. Each individual part of a given page (or document) is listed as nodes within the DOM tree itself,
      which are stored in a nodelist that acts similarly (but not entirely) to an array. Nodes can be all manner of
      things, from HTML elements, comments, text content, and attributes. Generally speaking when it comes to DOM
      manipulation you’ll disregard the majority of nodes that aren’t related to, or are elements themselves.<p> The DOM
        doesn’t just represent a static skeleton of the building blocks of a site, rather it is a live model that can be
        changed directly via Javascript. Through doing so you can manipulate, modify, add or remove anything from
        elements, CSS rules, attributes and practically anything else you can think of.The DOM doesn’t just represent a

      The DOM doesn’t just represent a static skeleton of the building blocks of a site, rather it is a live model that
      can be changed directly via Javascript. Through doing so you can manipulate, modify, add or remove anything from
      elements, CSS rules, attributes and practically anything else you can think of.
      Another incredibly useful part of the DOM is the ability for Javascript to add events to elements in order to
      register (or listen for) interactions performed by the user. These events have an absolutely titanic variety of
      uses that can range from registering a click event to tick a checkbox to detecting when a specific key is pressed,
      and that’s barely scratching the surface.
    </div>
    <div class="question">How does the DOM interact with HTML and CSS?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      The DOM relates to HTML and CSS in an interesting way, as changes made to any CSS rules or HTML within it aren’t
      actually applied to their corresponding files, instead, the changes are made to the specific instance of the
      document (webpage), so it has no lasting impact on styling or structure. As an example, you could freely change
      the styling of a p element on a page so that all of its text is red and underlined by modifying it’s CSS rules
      in the DOM, and it’d be instantly visible on your end, but one click of the refresh button or a press of F5 and
      the page will return to looking exactly as it did beforehand.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What does Javascript do to HTML and CSS? How do they relate?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">If I were to explain the relationship between CSS, HTML and Javascript I’d probably compare
      it to a puppet show of sorts. HTML and CSS are the puppets up on stage (or displayed on the page) whilst
      Javascript sits, obscured from view, pulling their strings to make them perform whatever task it decides they need
      to do. In this case, rather than dancing about, styling elements could be changed, and what was once a 14 pixel
      red box puppet could suddenly become a 25 pixel green circle with the pull of a few strings (lines of code) or a
      button could suddenly vanish when an audience member (the user) interacts with it.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What is control flow? How does it work?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>In terms of Javascript terminology, control flow is essentially the order of operations that
        code runs through whilst it’s executing. This flow travels through from the top of a code block down to the
        bottom, and will continue from there until it hits the last line or it hits a statement that can change the
        control flow. You might be asking “Okay, but what can change the control flow then?” and in that case, the
        answer
        is multiple things.</p> The first of which is conditionals (ie. if statements). These can change control flow by
      making it so that the code will not continue past the specific line until a condition is met. For example, imagine
      writing yourself a schedule for the end of the day that says “if dishes are done, relax”. The line of code to
      “relax” won’t be accessible by the control flow until the “dishes done” condition is met. <p>Another way to change
        flow is with loops, which work in a similar way, but are better for more specific, repetitive tasks. To rework
        the
        previous example/analogy for a loop, it’d be like if that same schedule said “wash dish, repeat for each dish,
        when the dish rack is empty, relax”. Here the control flow would get down to “wash dish”, try to move forward by
        checking if there were more dishes to do, and then doing each one until the dishrack empties and the flow
        control
        can finally reach the end. There’s one more thing that can modify control flow here, and that is functions. I’ll
        be discussing those in further detail shortly, so you’ll have to cool your jets for now until we circle back
        (devastating, I know).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">What’s the difference between arrays and objects?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The primary difference between arrays and objects is the way in which they store information.
      Arrays store data in consecutive memory locations, put plainly, it's similar to a sequenced list. Whereas objects
      on the other hand, store data in named key value pairs. This key value pair system is great for when you want to
      insert characteristics/properties about something/someone specific, and keep that information intrinsically
      connected to it within the object. Alternatively, arrays are incredibly handy when making ordered collections
      within a single variable.
      <p>When it comes to the type of information these two can store, they are on even footing, with both being able to
        store any primitive data type (which includes strings, numbers or booleans) as well as happily storing another
        object or array.</p>
      <p>Another area where these two differ though, is in how you access the information stored within
        them. For objects, the notation can be done via dot: object(eg. Greg).property(eg. Age) or square bracket:
        Greg[Age]. On the contrary, arrays are accessed with zero-based indexing, which is a particularly technical way
        of
        saying to start counting from zero rather than one. So for example, if you had an array of vehicles written as:
        let vehicles = [bike, car, unicycle, boat, helicopter,tank] you’d access the third item (unicycle) by writing:
        vehicles[2].</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">What are functions? Why are they helpful? (And why do they deserve their own section?)
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">Functions are a key part of Javascript and its ability to perform the tasks we desire it to.
      Functions act as a way to compound your code for a specific task or utility into a single functional and reusable
      unit, rather than a chaotic cacophony of spaghetti code.<p> One way they make themselves useful is by making
        coding
        with Javascript far more efficient by cutting down on repetition, as you can simply re-use your already written
        function if the need arises, rather than having to write the entirety of your code out twice.</p>
      <p> Another handy
        thing
        about functions is improving code readability. When writing a function, you will generally have a context for it
        to perform a task in. Because of this, it can make coming up with naming conventions for individual variables a
        lot easier, consequently making your code make more sense, even to the relatively untrained eye.</p>
