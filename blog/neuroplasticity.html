    <h1 class="heading">Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <div class="question"> How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Understanding neuroplasticity and its nuances can benefit people in a variety of ways, most
      of
      which revolve around how they frame their learning experiences. For example, if someone's learning style has been
      fairly rigid since they left highschool, they might expect all learning to be a dull affair in which you get
      bombarded by information and then get assessed on how well you retained it. The fundamentals of neuroplasticity
      push
      back against that idea, instead showing that the mind becomes more engaged and malleable when it’s given things
      that
      engage and challenge its expectations.<br> Also, understanding specific principles like “use it or lose it” can be
      instrumental in realizing that practice really does make perfect, and that leaving a specific skill behind or
      falling out of routine can have a very real, tangible impact on how well you can retain said abilities.
    </div>
    <div class="question">How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Engaging with these principles recently has been helping me throughout day to day life,
      especially in an educational context. The first of these principles I’ve been utilizing is “use it and improve
      it”.
      Before starting at Dev Academy, I began working through the Odin project for at least a few hours each day, so
      that
      I could come in with a sense of structure and discipline that was otherwise lacking, whilst also improving my
      technical skills and learning along the way. Another one of these principles I’ve been trying to practice
      regularly
      is “repetition matters”. Whenever I come back from the weekend to dive in once again, I tend to find myself
      feeling
      a bit confused and overwhelmed once I hit the point where I need to recall previously learned information. When
      that
      happens though, I’ve found it super useful to start looking through useful resources I’ve bookmarked and giving
      them
      another readthrough, as it reinforces that previously only partially retained information. I may not fully retain
      the information fully
      if it comes back around again, but there is a gradual improvement.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">There are plenty of ways to improve neuroplasticity throughout your day to day life, with a
      fair few of them even seeming small and inconsequential, but they’re far from it. The first of these is exercise.
      Exercise can sometimes seem antithetical (or opposite) to learning, given that you don’t have your head stuck into
      a
      book or hands hammering away at a keyboard, but it can be for that exact reason that it can be so beneficial.
      Generally, when you’re exercising you’ll be getting your body moving and a lot of its systems firing, which
      empowers
      the development of nerve cells and increases the connections between your brain’s synapses. Another way to
      increase
      <br>your neuroplasticity is oddly enough, changing your vocabulary and the way you mentally phrase things. If
      you’re
      one
      that's quick to throw around phrases like “I hate this” or “I’m failing, kill me now” genuinely just trying to be
      more fair to the task at hand, or if you’re anything like me just easing up on yourself. Replacing the “kill me
      now”
      at the end of your sentences with “I just don’t have it quite yet” can be shockingly impactful, as you’ve taken
      some
      of that dastardly self blame out and replaced it with something a lot more reasonable. At least from my
      experience,
      this can really help with not getting caught up in a thought spiral that would’ve otherwise just eaten up time and
      made me feel worse.

    <h1 class="heading">The Growth Mindset</h1>
    <div class="question">What is the “Growth Mindset” and why is it relevant?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The growth mindset is an approach to facing challenges or unforeseen setbacks that revolves
      around understanding that the struggle is part of the process, rather than a personal failure. It is incredibly
      relevant in the field of web and software development more broadly as hitting stumbling blocks is nigh
      on unavoidable in this field. If you were to approach programming with the alternate “fixed mindset” you wouldn’t
      last long before having your entire sense of self detonate when you inevitably run into a bug. The more I keep
      learning to program, the more obvious it becomes that perseverance is the name of the game, and the growth mindset
      is instrumental in building it.
    </div>
    <div class="question">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">I can’t say anything in particular has changed in this instance, but when I first heard about
      it, it flipped my established learning style on its head. When I began The Odin Project, I was still very much in
      the traditional highschool mindset thinking that failure of any variety was catastrophic and a negative mark on me
      as a person. I used to find myself burning out a lot and just giving up if something felt as if it wasn’t clicking
      the first time around. My previous mindset was very restrictive in the way that I thought I couldn’t take the time
      to gain skills when they were absent in the first place, whereas now I understand that being inexperienced in
      something generally means that you won’t be good at it immediately, and only delving into things you already have
      some talent for makes the scope of what you can learn significantly restricted.</div>
    <div class="question">How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">I feel like my previous answers already address this question well enough, but I’ll continue
      raving for a few more sentences. More than anything I feel that I need to approach this course and any greater
      context with some sense of compassion, so that I can continue to work through things I find challenging or even at
      times insurmountable without spiraling. I’ve already had quite a few moments here and during the Odin Project
      where
      I’ve really felt like I was in a hole and ready to give up, but every time so far and (hopefully) every time in
      future, I hope I can push through dust myself and persist regardless of the challenges I face.
