    <div class="question">What was a time you were blocked on a simple problem?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A time I was stuck on a simple problem was during the katas I just completed. There were
      quite a few times when I was stumped as to why my tests weren’t passing despite my code seemingly fitting the
      parameters of the test, only to realise I wasn’t even looking at the right tests, instead I was looking at a
      completely different set of tests for a later task. The problem solving technique I used to solve it was talking
      it out aloud, and having Kodi say to just look closer at the tests that were failing to figure out why, only to
      notice they weren’t the right tests whatsoever. I felt pretty bewildered during the time I was stuck, but
      afterward I learnt the lesson that I should probably read the tests prior to getting upset at the mere sight of
      red boxes.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of the given problem solving techniques
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">In terms of problem-solving techniques, I think I feel the most confident using search
      engines to try to navigate an issue. This is partially due to having a weak spot for syntax especially. I find
      most of the time that I need to see at least a few different contexts for a given concept or rule, so that I can
      understand what best fits my current situation/use case. The one I feel next most confident in would probably be
      console.logging, mainly because I enjoy having the ability to get extra insight as to exactly when a
      variable/function or anything else for that matter, produces an unexpected or undesired result. My third most
      utilised method is just trying something out. I find a lot of the time when I just try to take a swing at an
      issue, it's almost never going to suddenly be solved in its entirety, but I generally do make some headway towards
      a solution, even if it’s only a rough idea of how to structure it. Another method I utilise often is talking to my
      peers, or more specifically the person I work alongside, Kodi. We tend to discuss any sticking points we find
      ourselves in if we’re stumped, whilst also making a conscious effort to not just directly solve each other's
      problems in their entirety. I am also fairly confident when writing pseudocode, although I sometimes disregard it
      after writing it, even when it could’ve helped me think the issue more clearly<br>
      The methods I am a little more shaky on are definitely reading error messages, reaching out to
      coaches/facilitators for help and reflection. A lot of the time (in tests especially) I feel as if I vaguely
      understand what the error message is communicating, but at other points it seems like convoluted nonsense pointing
      me towards the general area where things might be going awry, but I still can’t really parse what the actual root
      of the issue is. When it comes to reaching out to facilitators for help, I feel that I have had issues asking
      people who feel like authorities on certain things for advice. This has been a point of contention for me since
      early schooling, as I would generally gain the reputation that I didn’t need help from teachers etc. Due to this
      I’m very reluctant to reach out, and sometimes I will just shut down and implode before actually just asking for
      assistance as it feels like a personal failure. The last thing I feel pretty underwhelming at is reflecting,
      especially after getting caught up in the problem too much. Being autistic, I often find it difficult to reflect
      in a non-self-critical manner on a range of things. For a long time, I’ve been the kind of person to get really
      stuck into the task at hand and work at it until I or it breaks. The further I get into this course, the more I
      realise it just leads to self-destructive behaviour and feeling like I want to give up. I’m actively trying to get
      better at self-reflection, rather than letting my self-awareness take the wheel, but it's quite a process.

    </div>
    <div class="question"> Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do
      so. What might you try differently next time?

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">As previously mentioned, unless it's my peers I’m almost always reluctant to ask for help. I
      really struggle to come to terms with the fact that I might be stuck or even just in need of a break, so I tend to
      soldier on until I can’t. I think (or at least hope) that in future I should be slightly more aware when I’m
      hitting my boiling point and actually just reach out if all previous methods have failed, rather than shutting
      down first, then trying the solutions afterward.</div>
