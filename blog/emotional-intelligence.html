      <div class="question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Having a grasp on how to perceive, control and utilize emotions to
        relate and communicate to others effectively. It can range from
        consciously hearing out people's grievances, having a general sense of
        social curiosity, to the ability to recognize when you’re feeling a
        strong emotion and accepting that it’s temporary.

      <div class="question">How is EQ different from IQ?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        EQ is all about your ability to identify and manage/express your
        emotions. It plays a vital part in helping you relate to others and
        communicate to others effectively. EQ is instrumental in not losing your
        cool and maintaining professional relationships with a calm demeanor.
        Whereas IQ is all about your capacity to learn, comprehend and analyze
        things from a more logical lens. While EQ is all about maintaining a
        balanced state of mind, IQ is moreso about utilizing said state of mind
        to work efficiently and improve the more hand-on aspects of your
        cognition eg. problem solving and other tests of your practical ability.

      <div class="question">Why is EQ important?</div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        EQ is a vital part of being a human in most landscapes, as effectively
        understanding other people is something that is practically unavoidable
        within society. Without EQ, the world would be a very different place,
        full of exclusively self-servient, uncaring (for lack of a better word)
        bastards. Because of emotional intelligence though, people have the
        capacity to forgive, empathize and alter their behaviour so that things
        are more harmonious
