    <div class="question">
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Elaborate
      on how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
      you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      One situation in which I found myself weighing up the ethical
      consequences of my actions was when I was recently writing an essay to
      just do a bit of journalism (of sorts, not published anywhere as of yet)
      surrounding the games industry. Whilst I was writing, at first I didn’t
      strictly adhere to writing down a factual record of certain events that
      were brought up as supplementary evidence for my arguments. When it came
      time to write the real thing, I sat and thought about whether I care
      about small factual inaccuracies. In the end, I decided that were I in
      the reader’s shoes or anyone who was involved in any of the mentioned
      events, it’d be pretty insulting to see details omitted or recorded
      incorrectly, even if it’s not being published by a larger entity. I
      decided to research after that thought, and on reflection it was not
      only the right move from an ethical standpoint, but also actually
      improved the quality and depth of the piece itself.

    <div class="question">
      How has your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      Throughout my life, the people I have been around and influenced the
      most by are those who put showing compassion towards others high in
      their list of priorities, along with trying to keep any harm to a
      minimum. As a result of this, I believe my sense of morals has been
      molded very strongly towards treating people fairly. In my time I have
      also seen plenty of examples of manipulation and exploitation, so
      whenever I see treatment that seems unfair or underhanded I’m generally
      quick to call it out, even though I’m generally fairly reserved in
      social situations.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Identify your strengths. How will they support you during your learning
      journey?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      of my core strengths is my attention to detail. From a young age I have
      enjoyed analyzing how almost everything in life is composed of smaller,
      intricate parts that all play a role in its existence or function. I
      think this will come in handy during my learning journey as being
      meticulously minded should help with getting even the more granular
      things in order before moving on. Another one of my strengths is
      open-mindedness and a desire to be as flexible as possible. I enjoy
      hearing a range of perspectives on a given issue or task, regardless of
      if they align with my own. I’m a firm believer that compromise is a key
      part of life, given that it's part of human nature to not see eye to eye
      on every issue. I think this will help along my learning journey because
      discussion and (eventual) agreement are a key part of working in a team,
      and I believe this openness should lead to less friction if I find
      myself suggesting an approach that doesn’t gel well with the rest of my
      collaborators.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      One limitation on my learning that I’ve recognised is that I struggle to
      really make myself known. I’ve always been a pretty shy person in social
      situations, preferring to just try to get through things without causing
      a fuss. This may affect my learning journey by hampering my ability to
      ask for help or even just present my work with a sense of pride, because
      I’d rather just get it over and done with so the spotlight is off of
      me.<br />
      Another limitation of mine is being overly anxious. I am a
      self-described chronic overthinker, tending to find myself in thought
      spirals a lot, sometimes before even actually getting to the thing I’m
      already so caught up on. This anxiety/stress has negatively impacted my
      learning journey in the past, and I think it will probably come back up
      given time, but I hope that I can better navigate my way through it with
      the lessons and methods I’ve learned since then.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
      others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
      tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
      other strategies you would try now and why.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      one point whilst volunteering at an SPCA Op Shop, two other volunteers
      were butting heads about their beliefs surrounding whether dogs should
      only be allowed in the store with a leash/harness on. I approached the
      problem by trying to clarify the potential risks of allowing an off
      leash dog into the store, and how it could lead to the harm of another
      customer. This strategy was fairly effective , as the person in favour
      of off-leash dogs hadn’t really thought through the risks to children or
      other vulnerable people. They did concede on the issue after that
      clarification, but in retrospect I definitely could have been more
      understanding of their perspective as well, so they felt less like I
      came over to undermine them.
